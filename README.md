What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  -Applying the appropriate code for the specified data structures. 
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  -The zybook samples that show which code is appropriate and how it will run, helped me. But it took hours of going over it. 
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  I now have a better understanding of structures and the appropriate code to apply depending upon the situation.
